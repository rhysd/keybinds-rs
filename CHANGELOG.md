# [v0.0.4](https://github.com/rhysd/keybinds-rs/releases/tag/v0.0.4) - 2025-02-19

- **BREAKING:** Use logical keys instead of physical keys. Now the characters in key sequence are case-sensitive. For example, logical key `A` means typing "A" and "Shift" physical keys and it is distinguished from `a` (only typing "A"). Along with this change, `Shift` modifier key was removed.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `KeybindDispatcher::trigger` to `KeybindDispatcher::dispatch`.
- Implement `FromIterator<Keybind<A>>` for `KeybindDispatcher<A>` to constructor a dispatcher instance from a list of key bindings easily.
- Implement `Deref<Target=[KeyBind]>` for `Keybinds` and implement `KeybindDispatcher::keybinds` getter method.
- Add API document for all optional features
- Add `minimal` and `serde` examples
